2016-01-17 20:13:58+00:00,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.",3544,1712
2016-01-17 20:06:21+00:00,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.",4219,1743
